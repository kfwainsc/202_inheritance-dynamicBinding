array
empty
Test whether array is empty
void
bool

array
fill
Sets parameter 'val' as the value for all the elements in the array object.
value_type& val 
void

array
size
Returns the number of elements in the array container.
void
size_type 

array
begin
Returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the array container.
void
iterator

array
end
Returns an iterator pointing to the past-the-end element in the array container.

VECTOR
Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size.
https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/
vector
clear
Removes all elements from the vector (which are destroyed), leaving the container with a size of 0.
void
void

vector
erase
Removes either a single element (position) or a range of elements ([first,last)). 
Position or Range [ first, last ]
iterator 

vector
constructor 
Had a default(), fill(size_type,datatype), range(begin,end), copy constructor, move constructor, and  initializer list constructor.
Dependent 
?

vector
resize
Resizes the container so that it contains n elements. 
New size, optional val
Throw exceptions on failure 

vector
shrink_to_fit
Requests the container to reduce its capacity to fit its size.

PYTHON LIB <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Zelle Graphics Library
a simple object oriented graphics library designed to make it very easy to experiment with computer graphics 
https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~knerr/cs21/s15/Labs/graphics.php
grapics.py
GraphWin
Constructs a new graphics window for drawing on the screen. 
title, width, height
---
 
graphics.py
plot
Draws pixel at (x,y) in the window. Color is optional, black is the default.
x, y, color
---

graphics.py
plotPixel
Draws pixel at the position (x,y) ignoring any coordinate transformations set up by setCoords.
x, y, Color
---

graphics.py
setBackground(color)
Sets the window background to the given color. The initial background is gray. 
args
---

graphics.py
close()
Closes the on-screen window.
args

graphics.py
getMouse()
Pauses for user to click a mouse in the window and returns where the mouse was clicked as a Point object.
void

graphics.py
checkMouse()
Similar to getMouse, but does not pause for a user click. 
void

TEMPLATES
A template is a blueprint or formula for creating a generic class or a function. Templates allow compiler to choose proper data type at compile time.
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_templates.htm
Benefits: reduces duplicate code.  Drawbacks: operators must be overloaded, not always a clear way to do this.
MODPROG >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
EXCEPTIONS
An exception forces calling code to recognize an error condition. An exception jumps to the point in the call stack that can handle the error. If not handled, program execution stops.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/errors-and-exception-handling-modern-cpp?view=msvc-170
Benefits: allows errors to be handled in another place and destructors excecuted.  Drawbacks: without proper documentation, it is unknown what exceptions might be thrown.
MODPROG >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
RANGE BASED FOR LOOP
A for loop that executes through a range, which is defined as anything that you can iterate through.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/range-based-loop-c/
Benefits: more readable for iterating through a containter than a traditional for loop.  Drawbacks: must keep a seprate counter if numeration needed.
